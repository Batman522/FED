# Real-Time Face Emotion Detection

A real-time face emotion detection system that uses deep learning techniques to recognize and classify facial emotions from video streams. This project leverages OpenCV for video processing and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for emotion classification.

## Features

- Real-time face emotion detection using a live webcam feed.
- Emotion classification into categories such as Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, etc.
- Optimized for performance to ensure smooth real-time processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `OpenCV` for video capture and processing.
  - `TensorFlow/Keras` for building and using the emotion classification model.
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations.
- **Dataset:** FER-2013 or similar labeled facial emotion dataset.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-emotion-detection.git
   cd face-emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Download or train the emotion classification model:**
   - You can use a pre-trained model or train your own using the provided training script (if applicable).
   - Save the model as `expression_model.h5` in the project directory.

2. **Run the real-time detection script:**
   ```bash
   python real_time_emotion_detection.py
   ```

3. **View the results:**
   - The script will open a webcam feed window where detected faces will be highlighted with their predicted emotions.
